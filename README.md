Project 7, CSCI245 Programming II, Spring 2020

This is a simple four function calculator that I have built in my second year of programming 
from scratch with exception for the JUnit tests and GUI. The challenge is to build a calculator
that handles all possible cases, including division by 0, without using any if/else statments, try/catch
blocks, or degenerate while loops. This was accomplished using several design patter, including the state
and strategy degin pattern. To use this calculator, run SetUp.java.
